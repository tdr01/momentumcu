<p>We’re helping support youth in need this year by supporting the Ontario Credit Union Foundation’s <strong>CU Succeed Bursary</strong> program!</p>
<p>Each year, 30% of youth in Ontario choose not to pursue higher education because of financial barriers and OCUF is working to change that. To date, the CU Succeed Bursary program has provided $111,000 to help students pursue their dreams of post-secondary education.</p>
<p>The 2018 goal is to raise $75,000 and MCU will be supporting the campaign by hosting various fundraising activities throughout the month of May and by accepting donations to the fund online. Members can donate to the fund by visiting our team page <strong><a href="https://ocuf.org/cu-succeed-momentum/">here</a></strong>. Tax receipts will be provided.</p>
<p>We will also be holding an in-branch raffle from May 7th to May 18th with all proceeds being donated to the bursary program. Visit a branch to enter for a chance to score a great prize!</p>
<p><strong>Do you know someone looking for student funding?</strong></p>
<p>Applications to the CU Succeed Youth Bursary are being accepted until June 30, 2018. Click <strong><a href="https://ocuf.org/bursary/">here</a></strong> for more information about eligibility and how to apply.</p>
<p><strong>Thanks for helping us support this very important initiative!</strong></p>
