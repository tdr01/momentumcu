<p>We’re helping support youth in need this year by supporting the Ontario Credit Union Foundation’s <strong>CU Succeed Bursary</strong> program!</p>
<p>Each year, 30% of youth in Ontario choose not to pursue higher education because of financial barriers and OCUF is working to change that. To date, the CU Succeed Bursary program has provided $111,000 to help students pursue their dreams of post-secondary education.</p>
<p>The 2018 goal is to raise $75,000 and MCU will be supporting the campaign by hosting various fundraising activities throughout the month of May and by accepting donations to the fund online. Members can donate to the fund by visiting our team page <strong><a href="https://ocuf.org/cu-succeed-momentum/">here</a></strong>. Tax receipts will be provided.</p>
<p>We will also be holding an in-branch raffle from May 7th to May 18th with all proceeds being donated to the bursary program. Visit a branch to enter for a chance to score a great prize!</p>
<p><strong>Do you know someone looking for student funding?</strong></p>
<p>Applications to the CU Succeed Youth Bursary are being accepted until June 30, 2018. Click <strong><a href="https://ocuf.org/bursary/">here</a></strong> for more information about eligibility and how to apply.</p>
<p><strong>Thanks for helping us support this very important initiative!</strong></p>

<p>We&#8217;re thrilled to share our Holiday Toy Drive is back for its third year! Our branch staff is once again collecting toys for kids aged 12 and under which will be provided to organizations in each of our branch communities.</p>
<p>With the hustle and bustle of the holiday season, it&#8217;s easy to forget that not every child gets to experience the same joy on Christmas morning. By providing toys to kids in need, we are also helping alleviate stress for parents who may not be able to afford to buy their kids gifts themselves.</p>
<p>For those who want to help but don&#8217;t have time to shop, we&#8217;re also collecting monetary donations to our toy drive fund which will be used to purchase additional toys.</p>
<p>This year, toys will be donated to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Brampton – <a href="http://flrc.ca/en/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Honeychurch Family Life Resource Centre</span></a></li>
<li>Oakville – <a href="http://haltonwomensplace.com/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Halton Women’s Place</span></a></li>
<li>Hamilton – <a title="CityKidz" href="https://citykidz.ca/christmas/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">CityKidz</span></a></li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks to our staff, members, and partners, we&#8217;ve been able to make the holiday season a little brighter for hundreds of kids in need over the years and we look forward to doing it again! We couldn&#8217;t be more grateful for your support.</p>
<p>Donations will be accepted until December 18th.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Ontario Credit Union Foundation (OCUF) is one again accepting applications for their student bursary program.</p>
<p>Last year, this exceptional organization provided $51,000 to 42 students in need to help pay for post-secondary education. How awesome is that?! This program has become a great resource for youth who are planning on attending a post-secondary school, or participating in technical or vocational training, who may not otherwise be able to afford higher education.</p>
<p>The goal this year is to provide $60,000 in bursaries ranging from $1,000 to $2,500 so many lucky students will be able to reap the benefits of the program. The average tuition cost in Canada in 2016 was $6,400 so every bit helps! We encourage anyone who is eligible to apply before the deadline on June 30th.</p>
<p>For full eligibility requirements and to apply, visit the OCUF <a title="CU Succeed Youth Bursary" href="https://ocuf.org/bursary/">website</a>.</p>

<p>International Credit Union (ICU) Day® is taking place a week from today so it seemed only fitting to share more info about this very special celebration!</p>
<p>Credit unions have been celebrating what makes us different (and better!) on ICU Day® since 1948. The day is held to recognize the history and achievements of CUs around the world while raising awareness about all the great work they are doing. Credit unions everywhere will celebrate in various ways including fundraisers, giveaways, contests, and open houses.</p>
<p>This year, we are highlighting what makes credit unions truly unique under the theme of &#8220;The Authentic Difference” launched by the World Council of Credit Unions that works as an advocate for credit unions in matters of legislation, education and training, networking, outreach and encouraging the co-operative model.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a little known fact that credit unions have played an important role in the Canadian financial industry. With over 100 years serving its members, credit unions are responsible for many important &#8220;firsts&#8221;. Some of them are:</p>
<p>• First to provide ownership and membership to all members</p>
<p>• First personal loan based on borrower’s character</p>
<p>• First payroll deduction service for deposits and loan payments</p>
<p>• First open mortgages</p>
<p>• First to lend to women in their own names</p>
<p>• First variable rate mortgage</p>
<p>• First personal line of credit</p>
<p>• First full-service ATM network</p>
<p>• First home equity line of credit</p>
<p>• First debit card service</p>
<p>• First point-of-sale debit payment service</p>
<p>• First registered education savings plan</p>
<p>• First fully-functional online banking</p>
<p>We know—credit unions are pretty awesome!</p>
<p>We haven&#8217;t forgotten our members either. We will be handing out a special gift to show appreciation to all members who stop in to see us on October 20th.</p>
<p>Be sure to check out #ICUDay on social media next week to see what all the credit unions are up to on ICU Day®!</p>
